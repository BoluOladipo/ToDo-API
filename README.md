# Todo List PWA

This is a simple Todo List application built as a Progressive Web App (PWA) with offline functionality, date and time reminders, and notifications.

## Features

* **Add, Edit, and Delete Tasks**: Easily manage your tasks.
* **Date & Time Reminders**: Set reminders with specific dates and times for tasks.
* **Offline Support**: Access your todo list even when you're offline, thanks to PWA caching.
* **Push Notifications**: Receive reminders when your tasks are due.
* **PWA Functionality**: Install the app on your device like a native app with offline capabilities.

## Tech Stack

* **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
* **Backend**: Node.js and Express (for managing the task API)
* **PWA Features**: Service Workers, Manifest file
* **Icons**: Custom icons for the app

## Installation

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/todo-pwa.git
cd todo-pwa
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

First, you need to install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Run the Backend Server

Start the backend server to handle the task API:

```bash
npm start
```

By default, the backend server will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

### 4. Open the Frontend

To start using the app, open `index.html` in your browser. You can also run a local development server if you prefer. If you're using VS Code, you can use the `Live Server` extension to quickly view the app.

### 5. Test the PWA

Once the app is loaded in the browser:

1. **Install the PWA**:

   * If you're using Chrome, you should see an install prompt in the browser's address bar. You can also manually install it via the "Install" option in the menu.
2. **Test Offline Functionality**:

   * To test offline functionality, disable your internet connection and open the app. You should still be able to access the todo list and add tasks.
3. **Test Notifications**:

   * Make sure to grant notification permissions when prompted. You should receive task reminders when the specified time arrives.

### 6. Push to GitHub Pages or a Server

For testing or deployment, you can upload the app to GitHub Pages or deploy it on any static hosting service like Netlify or Vercel.

## How It Works

### Service Worker

The `service-worker.js` file caches critical files such as the `index.html`, `style.css`, and the app's icons. The service worker ensures that the app functions offline by serving cached files when the network is unavailable.

### Manifest File

The `manifest.json` file defines the app's appearance when installed on a device. It includes the app's name, icons, and other metadata.

### Backend API

The backend is built with Express.js and is responsible for storing and managing tasks. It uses a simple in-memory array for task data.
